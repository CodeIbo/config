# 🗂️ LocalServer

LocalServer is a lightweight setup for local-only development using:

- 🌐 **Nginx** for hosting local `.local` domains
- 📧 **Samba** for LAN-only file sharing

Both are restricted to LAN access via UFW.

## ✅ Quick Start

- See [nginx](./nginx/README.MD) for local domain hosting
- See [samba](./samba/README.MD) for local file sharing setup
