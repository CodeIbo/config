# 🧰 System Setup - Cross-Platform Toolkit

This folder provides environment setup scripts and helpers for provisioning development machines across **Windows** and **Linux**.

The goal is to automate:

- Installing essential software packages
- Configuring shell environments and terminals
- Creating reusable, modular config layers

## 🪟 Windows Setup

A complete setup flow for Windows is already available.

Includes:

- Chocolatey-based package installation
- Terminal tools (WezTerm, Neovim, Git, etc.)
- Custom PowerShell profile scripts
- Optional CLI wrappers (like `yt`, `ff`, `cfg`)

📄 See [`setup/windows/README.md`](windows/README.md) for full details.

## 🐧 Linux Setup _(coming soon)_
